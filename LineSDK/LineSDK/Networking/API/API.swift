/// A utility type for calling APIs on the LINE Platform.
///
/// - Note:
/// For most API calls, using the methods in the `API` is equivalent to using and sending an
/// underlying `Request` object with a `Session` object. However, some methods in `API` provide
/// additional useful features such as working with the keychain and redirecting the final result 
/// in a more reasonable way.
///
/// Using methods in `API` to interact with the LINE Platform is highly recommended unless you are familiar
/// with and want to extend the LINE SDK to send unimplemented API requests to the LINE Platform.
