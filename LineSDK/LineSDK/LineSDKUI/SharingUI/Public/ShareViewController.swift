/**
 A view controller that provides a default UI for selecting friends and groups,
 then share some `Message`s to the selected targets.

 ## Overview

 A `ShareViewController` allows users to share a message to LINE via a default UI.
 An authorized user can browse, search, and select up to 10 users or groups in a tab-based table view UI.
 After choosing their share targets, the user taps "Send" to share a preset `Message` to the targets. 
 The message appears to the target recipients as having been sent by the user themselves.

 `ShareViewController` is a subclass of `UINavigationController`, so you need to create and present it modally.
 To use `ShareViewController`, follow these steps:

 1. Verify that the user has granted your app the necessary permissions. `ShareViewController` will show both
 Friends and Groups tabs. To get the friend list and group list, and send a message, you need
 `LoginPermission.oneTimeShare`. Use `ShareViewController.localAuthorizationStatusForSendingMessage()` to check
 whether you have a valid token with the necessary permissions. If you don't have them, don't create and
 show the `ShareViewController`, but instead prompt your user to grant your app the needed permissions.

 2. Create a `ShareViewController` instance. `ShareViewController` can't be initialized from Storyboard or
 XIB. Use the provided initializer `init()`.

 3. Specify `messages` to tell the `ShareViewController` the `Message` values you want to share.

 4. Present the created `ShareViewController` modally by calling `present(_:animated:completion:)`.

 You can customize the `ShareViewController` navigation bar style and status bar content style to match your app.
 Use `navigationBarTintColor`, `navigationBarTextColor`, and `statusBarStyle` to do so.

 ## Share Delegate

 `ShareViewController` will deliver results of user interaction to a delegate object. To get these related events,
 you must provide a delegate that conforms to the `ShareViewControllerDelegate` protocol, and set it to `shareDelegate`
 property.

 See `ShareViewControllerDelegate` for more information.

 - Warning:
 Although `ShareViewController` is marked as `open`, we recommend against creating a subclass for it. The class is
 intended to be used as-is, to ensure a consistent sharing experience across all LINE and LINE SDK integrations. Users
 expect sharing messages to friends and groups in LINE to work the same across different apps. Nevertheless, if you 
 absolutely need a custom sharing interaction, you can create it using the related APIs.
