/// A controller which manages open chat creating operations.
///
/// It checks whether the Open Chat user term has been accepted by current user. If accepted, LINE SDK shows a standard
/// open chat creating interface to collect information from user input, then try to create the open chat room based on
/// them. Otherwise, the user is prompted to agree the term first before an open chat room can be created.
///
/// It is encouraged to call `OpenChatCreatingController.localAuthorizationStatusForCreatingOpenChat()` first and check
/// the authorization status to make sure your user has authorized you to create an open chat. Then call
/// `loadAndPresent(in:presentedHandler:)` to show the built-in UI to collect user information and create the open chat
/// room.
///
/// To get the result of the creating controller or have more control of the behaviors, implement methods in
/// `OpenChatCreatingControllerDelegate` and set `delegate` property of an `OpenChatCreatingController` instance.
///
/// - Note:
/// The class is intended to be used as-is and to provide a default open chat creating experience across all LINE and
/// LINE SDK integrations. Users expect a consistent UI and interaction across different apps when using the Open Chat
/// features. But if it's so important for you to provide a fully customized sharing interaction, you can still use the
///  related APIs to create your own UIs.
///

    /// better experience when an event happens.

    ///   - viewController: A presenting view controller from which the open chat creating view controller should be
    ///                     presented from. Normally, it should be your current top-most view controller which takes
    ///                     responsibility of user interaction.
    ///   - handler: A block called when the open chat creating view controller presenting action is done with a result.
    ///
    /// - Note:
    /// If the `handler` is called with a `.failure` case, it means there is no view controller from LINE SDK
    /// shown. A few reasons can cause it, such as term agreement status cannot be retrieved due to network error.
    /// On the other hand, a `.success` case and its associated value means a view controller from LINE SDK is
    /// presented. But it does not mean that the open chat room is created. To handle either the creating failure or
    /// success case for the whole process, you need to use the methods in `OpenChatCreatingControllerDelegate`.
    ///
    /// For either result, it is a chance for you to remove any blocking UI you may add to your view controller, like
